  abstract = {Abstract Scheduling multicast traffic in input-queued switches to maximize throughput requires solving a hard combinatorial optimization problem in a very short time. This task advocates the design of algorithms that are simple to implement and efficient in terms of performance. We propose a new scheduling algorithm, based on message passing and inspired by the belief propagation paradigm, meant to approximate the provably-optimal scheduling policy for multicast traffic. We design and implement both a software and a hardware version of the algorithm, the latter running on a NetFPGA. We compare the performance and the power consumption of the two versions when integrated in a software router. Our main findings are that our algorithm outperforms other centralized greedy scheduling policies, achieving a better tradeoff between complexity and performance, and it is amenable to practical high-performance implementations. },

  abstract = {This paper presents the first sublinear-time deterministic parallel algorithms for bipartite matching and several related problems, including maximal node-disjoint paths, depth-first search, and flows in zero-one networks. Our results are based on a better understanding of the combinatorial structure of the above problems. which leads to new algorithmic techniques. In particular, we show how to use maximal matching to extend, in parallel, a current set of node-disjoint paths and how to take advantage of the parallelism that arises when a large number of nodes are #active# during an execution of a push-relabel network flow algorithm. We also show how to apply our techniques to design parallel algorithms for the weighted versions of the above problems. In particular, we present sublinear-time deterministic parallel algorithms for finding a minimum-weight bipartite matching and for finding a minimum-cost flow in a network with zero-one capacities, if the weights are polynomially bounded integers.},
