Our results are based on a better understanding of the combinatorial structure of the above problems. which leads to new algorithmic techniques. In particular, we show how to use maximal matching to extend, in parallel, a current set of node-disjoint paths and how to take advantage of the parallelism that arises when a large number of nodes are #active# during an execution of a push-relabel network flow algorithm. We also show how to apply our techniques to design parallel algorithms for the weighted versions of the above problems. In particular, we present sublinear-time deterministic parallel algorithms for finding a minimum-weight bipartite matching and for finding a minimum-cost flow in a network with zero-one capacities, if the weights are polynomially bounded integers.},

The algorithms generate new schedules in a distributed manner via simple local changes to existing schedules. The class is parameterized by integers k{\textbackslash}geq 1. We show that algorithm k of our class achieves k/(k+2) of the capacity region, for every k{\textbackslash}geq 1. . The algorithms have small and constant worst-case overheads: in particular, algorithm k generates a new schedule using (a) time less than 4k+2 round-trip times between neighboring nodes in the network, and (b) at most three control transmissions by any given node, for any k. The control signals are explicitly specified, and face the same interference effects as normal data transmissions. Our class of distributed wireless scheduling algorithms are the first ones guaranteed to achieve any fixed fraction of the capacity region while using small and constant overheads that do not scale with network size. The parameter k explicitly captures the tradeoff between control overhead and scheduler throughput performance and provides a tuning knob protocol designers can use to harness this trade-off in practice.},

Previously known scheduling policies that guarantee comparable capacity regions are either centralized or require computation time that increases with the size of the network. In contrast, the unique feature of the proposed distributed scheduling policies is that they are constant-time policies, i.e., given a fixed approximation ratio and a bounded maximum node-degree of the network, the time needed for computing a new schedule is independent of the network size. Hence, they can be easily deployed in large networks.},

The first algorithm requires each link to collect local queue-length information in its neighborhood, and its complexity is otherwise independent of the size and topology of the network. The second algorithm, presented for the node-exclusive interference model, does not require nodes to collect queue-length information even in their local neighborhoods, and its complexity depends only on the maximum node degree in the network.},

Our results are based on a better understanding of the combinatorial structure of the above problems. which leads to new algorithmic techniques. In particular, we show how to use maximal matching to extend, in parallel, a current set of node-disjoint paths and how to take advantage of the parallelism that arises when a large number of nodes are #active# during an execution of a push-relabel network flow algorithm. We also show how to apply our techniques to design parallel algorithms for the weighted versions of the above problems. In particular, we present sublinear-time deterministic parallel algorithms for finding a minimum-weight bipartite matching and for finding a minimum-cost flow in a network with zero-one capacities, if the weights are polynomially bounded integers.},

The algorithms generate new schedules in a distributed manner via simple local changes to existing schedules. The class is parameterized by integers k{\textbackslash}geq 1. We show that algorithm k of our class achieves k/(k+2) of the capacity region, for every k{\textbackslash}geq 1. . The algorithms have small and constant worst-case overheads: in particular, algorithm k generates a new schedule using (a) time less than 4k+2 round-trip times between neighboring nodes in the network, and (b) at most three control transmissions by any given node, for any k. The control signals are explicitly specified, and face the same interference effects as normal data transmissions. Our class of distributed wireless scheduling algorithms are the first ones guaranteed to achieve any fixed fraction of the capacity region while using small and constant overheads that do not scale with network size. The parameter k explicitly captures the tradeoff between control overhead and scheduler throughput performance and provides a tuning knob protocol designers can use to harness this trade-off in practice.},

Previously known scheduling policies that guarantee comparable capacity regions are either centralized or require computation time that increases with the size of the network. In contrast, the unique feature of the proposed distributed scheduling policies is that they are constant-time policies, i.e., given a fixed approximation ratio and a bounded maximum node-degree of the network, the time needed for computing a new schedule is independent of the network size. Hence, they can be easily deployed in large networks.},

The first algorithm requires each link to collect local queue-length information in its neighborhood, and its complexity is otherwise independent of the size and topology of the network. The second algorithm, presented for the node-exclusive interference model, does not require nodes to collect queue-length information even in their local neighborhoods, and its complexity depends only on the maximum node degree in the network.},
