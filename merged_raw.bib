 abstract = {Abstract Scheduling multicast traffic in input-queued switches to maximize throughput requires solving a hard combinatorial optimization problem in a very short time. This task advocates the design of algorithms that are simple to implement and efficient in terms of performance. We propose a new scheduling algorithm, based on message passing and inspired by the belief propagation paradigm, meant to approximate the provably-optimal scheduling policy for multicast traffic. We design and implement both a software and a hardware version of the algorithm, the latter running on a NetFPGA. We compare the performance and the power consumption of the two versions when integrated in a software router. Our main findings are that our algorithm outperforms other centralized greedy scheduling policies, achieving a better tradeoff between complexity and performance, and it is amenable to practical high-performance implementations. },

 abstract = {We consider the problem of designing distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks. We present two algorithms, both of which achieve throughput arbitrarily close to that of maximal schedules, but whose complexity is low due to the fact that they do not necessarily attempt to find maximal schedules. The first algorithm requires each link to collect local queue-length information in its neighborhood, and its complexity is otherwise independent of the size and topology of the network. The second algorithm, presented for the node-exclusive interference model, does not require nodes to collect queue-length information even in their local neighborhoods, and its complexity depends only on the maximum node degree in the network.},

The control signals are explicitly specified, and face the same interference effects as normal data transmissions. Our class of distributed wireless scheduling algorithms are the first ones guaranteed to achieve any fixed fraction of the capacity region while using small and constant overheads that do not scale with network size. The parameter k explicitly captures the tradeoff between control overhead and scheduler throughput performance and provides a tuning knob protocol designers can use to harness this trade-off in practice.},

@article{ShahShin2012rand,
 abstract = {There has recently been considerable interest in design of low-complexity, myopic, distributed and stable scheduling algorithms for constrained queueing network models that arise in the context of emerging communication networks. Here we consider two representative models. One, a queueing network model that captures randomly varying number of packets in the queues present at a collection of wireless nodes communicating through a shared medium. Two, a buffered circuit switched network model for an optical core of future internet to capture the randomness in calls or flows present in the network. The maximum weight scheduling algorithm proposed by Tassiulas and Ephremides [IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 37 (1992) 1936-1948], leads to a myopic and stable algorithm for the packet-level wireless network model. But computationally it is expensive (NP-hard) and centralized. It is not applicable to the buffered circuit switched network due to the requirement of nonpreemption of the calls in the service. As the main contribution of this paper, we present a stable scheduling algorithm for both of these models. The algorithm is myopic, distributed and performs few logical operations at each node per unit time.},
